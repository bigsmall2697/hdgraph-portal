                    Always backup your keys: MyEtherWallet.com &amp;
                    MyEtherWallet CX are not "web wallets". You do not create an
                    account or give us your funds to hold onto. No data leaves
                    your computer / your browser. We make it easy for you to
                    create, save, and access your information and interact with

                    We are not responsible for any loss: Ethereum,
                    MyEtherWallet.com &amp; MyEtherWallet CX, and some of the
                    underlying Javascript libraries we use are under active
                    development. While we have thoroughly tested &amp; tens of
                    thousands of wallets have been successfully created by
                    people all over the globe, there is always the possibility
                    something unexpected happens that causes your funds to be
                    lost. Please do not invest more than you are willing to
                    lose, and please be careful.
